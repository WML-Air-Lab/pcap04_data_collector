# pcap04_data_collector
This is a vibe coded tool for collecting data from com ports and plotting it live and allowing data save. I'm not a big vibe coding fan, but wanted to whip up the tool quickly and figured it was simple enough to let AI do it. 

It can handle 5 different sensors, and looks for comma seperated serial input on a com port. 

Run setup_env.bat to initialize the system, run_test.bat for running application.
